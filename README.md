Project Summary:

In this project, various data cleaning, machine learning preprocessing, and data visualization techniques were applied to a dataset of Amazon products. The objective was to clean, preprocess, and visualize the data to gain insights into product ratings, pricing, and categories. Here's a breakdown of the tools and techniques used:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Pandas: This powerful library was used for data manipulation and cleaning. We used it to load the dataset, remove currency symbols from price columns, and handle missing values in the ratings column.
Scikit-learn: The LabelEncoder from Scikit-learn was applied to encode categorical variables (like product categories) into numerical values to make the dataset ready for machine learning models.
Data Visualization:

Seaborn & Matplotlib: These libraries were used for visualizing the relationships and distributions in the dataset. Specifically:
Heatmap: A correlation heatmap was created to visualize the relationships between numeric variables such as discounted_price, actual_price, and rating.
Histogram: A histogram was plotted to analyze the distribution of ratings, providing insights into the overall ratings distribution of products.
Box Plot: A box plot was used to examine the distribution of discounted prices across different product categories.
Machine Learning Preparation:

While the current project focuses on data cleaning and visualization, the preprocessing steps performed (such as encoding categorical features and handling missing values) would enable the dataset to be ready for future machine learning tasks, such as predicting product ratings or pricing strategies.
Tools Used:
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
Scikit-learn for encoding categorical variables
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization (heatmap, histogram, and box plot)
This project demonstrates the initial steps of preparing data for further analysis or machine learning tasks, while also offering valuable visual insights into the datasetâ€™s structure and relationships.

Inspiration

Amazon is an American Tech Multi-National Company whose business interests include E-commerce, where they buy and store the inventory, and take care of everything from shipping and pricing to customer service and returns. I've created this dataset so that people can play with this dataset and do a lot of things as mentioned below
